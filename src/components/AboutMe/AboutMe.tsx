              I'm currently seeking entry-level full-stack or backend
              engineering roles where I can apply my experience, contribute
              meaningfully, and continue learning in a collaborative, fast-paced
              environment. As a Research Assistant, I designed ParV2, a
              runtime-based concurrency abstraction in Go that enables safe
              parallel execution of multiple functions. This project addressed a
              core limitation in Goâ€™s concurrency model and laid the groundwork
              for ongoing research into Artificial Neural Networks. Outside of
              research, I built FitTrack AI, a full-stack platform that helps
              runners train for half marathons using real-time feedback and AI
              support. The app generates adaptive training plans based on mood,
              sleep, and prior workout data. These projects reflect my ability
              to operate across the stack - from designing low-level systems to
              deploying AI-powered user applications - with a focus on
              thoughtful engineering, adaptability, and real-world impact.
